# Session Handoff Buffer

This file is updated after each file modification during a Claude Code session.
It serves as a buffer before content is transferred to `README_project_history.md`.

Always read `CLAUDE.md` in case I updated it in between sessions.

## Previous Session Context

**Branch merged:** `video_recording_long_term_storage_fix_JAN_19_2025_a` → `main`

**See:** `docs/README_project_history.md` for full history (search for "January 19, 2026")

### Key Accomplishments (Jan 19):

1. **Storage Migration System** - Complete two-tier rsync-based migration
   - Service: `services/recording/storage_migration.py`
   - Config: `config/recording_settings.json` (storage_paths, migration sections)
   - API: 6 endpoints at `/api/storage/*`
   - UI: `static/js/settings/storage-status.js` + CSS

2. **Timeline Query Fix** - Fixed "No recordings found" bug
   - File: `services/recording/timeline_service.py:206-224`
   - Added compound PostgREST filter with both gte and lte

3. **SQL Migration** - `file_operations_log` table created

## TODO List

**Testing Needed (after container restart):**

- [ ] Test timeline playback shows recordings for selected date range
- [ ] Test storage status appears in Settings panel
- [ ] Test "Migrate Now" button triggers migration
- [ ] Test "Cleanup Archive" button works
- [ ] Test "Reconcile DB" button removes orphaned entries
- [ ] Test progress bars show correct disk usage with color coding

**Future Enhancements:**

- [ ] Scheduler integration (APScheduler) for automated migrations
- [ ] Add pan/scroll for zoomed timeline
- [ ] Add segment preview on hover
- [ ] Add direct video playback in modal (before export)

**Deferred:**

- [ ] Database-backed recording settings (see `docs/README_plan_for_user_based_settings_implementation.md`)
- [ ] Camera settings UI (credentials, resolution)
- [ ] Container self-restart mechanism
